 This is course project of 'Getting and Cleaning Data' on Coursera website (https://class.coursera.org/getdata-002). 
 The requirement is making a tiny data set from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

 To make a tiny data set, I created a R script (run_analysis.R). 
 It is all about convinient in processing data, so I copied the following files into a folder named 'analysis'.
  - X_train.txt, X_test.txt
  - subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt
  - y_train.txt, y_test.txt
  - features.txt, activity_labels.txt

 Run the script in R by using this command: source("run_analysis.R"). Then, the result is tiny_data.csv file.
